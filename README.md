# OPSWAT_CODING_CHALLENGE

Problem Description: Generate a simple program to scan a file against our metadefender.opswat.com API. OPSWAT online help contains details of our publicly available API along with sample code that shows how to scan a file. However, it is costly to multi-scan a file so we would like you to implement a hash lookup prior to deciding to upload a file, either way you should retrieve results and display them. Please read through the documentation and sample code found at https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/2._Public_APIs.html to perform the following logic.

1. Calculate the hash of the given samplefile.txt
2. Perform a hash lookup against metadefender.opswat.com and see if their are previously cached results for the file
3. If results found then skip to 6
4. If results not found then upload the file, receive a data_id
5. Repeatedly pull on the data_id to retrieve results
6. Display results in format below

You should also have some basic error handling for common HTTP results, but its not necessary to account for every idiosyncrocy of our API. You can show any errors to the standard error and exit the application.

SAMPLE INPUT COMMAND: upload_file samplefile.txt

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

filename: samplefile.txt
overall_status: Clean

engine: Ahnlab
threat_found: SomeBadMalwareWeFound
scan_result: 1
def_time: 2017-12-05T13:54:00.000Z

engine: Cyren
threat_found: Clean
scan_result: 0
def_time: 2017-12-05T17:43:00.000Z

<repeats for each engine>

What you will need/helpful hints
1. You will need to register for a free account at portal.opswat.com. This will create an account and generate
a trial apikey for metadefender.opswat.com. The apikey should be displayed on the "Home" tab once you login
to your portal account. Please note this apikey has rate limiting which you may encounter, this is normal.
2. All of the API descriptions can be found under https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/2._Public_APIs.html
pay particular attention to the following
-https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/API_Authentication_Mechanisms.html
-https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/1.1_Scanning_a_file_by_file_upload.html
-https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/1.2_Retrieving_scan_reports_using_data_ID.html
-https://onlinehelp.opswat.com/mdcloud/2.1_Retrieving_scan_reports_using_a_data_hash.html

What we are looking to see.
1. Smart component choices, we don't expect you to write a JSON parser or reinvent a HTTP client. 
2. Clean and well documented code. Any language choice is fine but should be something easily installed and evaluated. 
3. A publicly available GIT repo that should contain all your code minus your apikey, we will be providing
our own key when we test it out ourselves.
4. A cleanly written and descriptive README that instructs us how to build and execute your project. We will
be testing your project on a clean Ubuntu 16.04+ VM or Visual Studio 2017 Windows machine. You can use whatever language or 3rd party library you want, but it should build and execute out of the box on the VM, so test accordingly.
